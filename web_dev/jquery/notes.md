## Plan of Action

Plan to use the jquery book that I bought in phase 0. I feel like google will play a factor but psuedocode will get me to that point where I will only need how to execute a few commands. I feel like I should commit as much as I did with ruby, test my file each time i write something new. I should psuedocode along with creating my program.

## Project Psuedocode
I want to create something simple, I think I would want to create a calculator, simple sweet and a good way to test my knowledge.
