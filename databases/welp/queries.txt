Prints out all tables but does not join them with only relevant data. 
I was thinking all of something like this 
--sqlite> SELECT * FROM reviews, users.id, businessess.id JOIN reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businessess.id;--

This is what I got.
sqlite>  SELECT * FROM reviews, users, businessess WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = businessess.id;

Second question
sqlite> select users.first, businessess.name, reviews.comment, reviews.stars from reviews inner join users on reviews.user_id=users.id inner join businessess on reviews.business_id=businessess.id;
